Basic test question for a very specific form

This is a javascript only test question that is using ids from a specific contact form that we use.  Note that this
does no server side verification so spam is still possible by avoiding this form altogether if the bot sends a 
post to the same destination that your form sends posts to.

This lists a simple math question where the user is required to add two numbers that are randomly generated from 1 to 6.
I thought adding numbers higher than 6 might be too difficult for some users, ;-)

To use this, you will need to change the referencing ids and/or classes to match your form.

Any improvement to this is welcomed!
